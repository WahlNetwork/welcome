# How Terraform and Continuous Integration Transformed Our Multi-Cloud Operations

> This is the story of a small infrastructure teamâ€™s quest to forever change how infrastructure is provisioned and managed across multiple cloud providers. We walk through all of the steps required to go from toiling over a pile of hand-crafted misery to a well-oiled continuous integration machine fueled by Terraform. Learn how we approached code design, workflows, prototyping, bake-offs, team collaboration, remote state, repository design, and more. Demos and sample code included!
