# Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This organization provides helpful resources as a companion to the [Wahl Network website](https://wahlnetwork.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Wahlnetwork). It is managed and maintained by [Chris Wahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahlchris/). This is a [safe, welcoming place](COC.md) in which all participants are treated with respect and dignity.

> Note: You can use the [example](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aexample+org%3AWahlNetwork&type=Repositories) topic to search for repositories containing example use cases and solutions.

## Resources

When giving a presentation, I create a resource page for the audience to easily find links to helpful blog posts, videos, code samples, and more. Visit the [Resources](/resources) page for a full list.

## Archived Repositories

When a project no longer has further life or interest from the community it is marked as _Archived_ and becomes read only. This is to preserve the history and avoid breaking inbound URLs.
